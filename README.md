===============================

# Welcome to a classic version of Frogger.  

## The object is to pass by the bugs and not get hit.  Using your arrow keys to cross the gray bricks to reach the water edge will ensure a win for your character.  In this game you can move up, down, left, and right.  If your character collides with any of the bugs, they will be reset to the position in which they started the game.  

## The game ends when you your character hits the water edge.  A message will shortly appear after that happens.

## Good Luck and have fun.

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
